# PostHog MCP

## Use the MCP Server

### Quick install

You can install the MCP server automatically into popular clients by running the following command:

```
npx @posthog/wizard@latest mcp add
```

### Manual install

1. Obtain a personal API key using the MCP Server preset [here](https://app.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys?preset=mcp_server).

2. Add the MCP configuration to your desktop client (e.g. Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop) and add your personal API key

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "posthog": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote@latest",
        "https://mcp.posthog.com/sse",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${POSTHOG_AUTH_HEADER}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "POSTHOG_AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer {INSERT_YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY_HERE}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using EU cloud or self-hosted instances

If you're using PostHog EU cloud or a self-hosted instance, you can specify a custom base URL by adding the `POSTHOG_BASE_URL` environment variable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "posthog": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote@latest",
        "https://mcp.posthog.com/sse",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${POSTHOG_AUTH_HEADER}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "POSTHOG_AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer {INSERT_YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY_HERE}",
        "POSTHOG_BASE_URL": "https://eu.posthog.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **⚠️ Important:** The MCP server is currently hosted on Cloudflare Workers. While you can specify EU or other regional PostHog instances, there is no guarantee that your data will remain within or be processed exclusively in that region due to the nature of Cloudflare's global infrastructure. We are working on a hosted version for EU cloud to ensure proper data residency, in the meantime you are welcome to deploy this server on your own infrastructure.

# Development

To run the MCP server locally, run the following command:

```
pnpm run dev
```

And replace `https://mcp.posthog.com/sse` with `http://localhost:8787/sse` in the MCP configuration.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized to support multiple language implementations:

- `typescript/` - TypeScript implementation (current)
- `python/` - Python implementation (planned)
- `schema/` - Shared schema files generated from TypeScript for cross-language compatibility

### Development Commands

- `pnpm run dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm run schema:build:json` - Generate JSON schema for other language implementations
- `pnpm run lint:fix` - Format and lint code

### Environment variables

- Create `.dev.vars` in the root
- Add Inkeep API key to enable `docs-search` tool (see `Inkeep API key - mcp`)

```
INKEEP_API_KEY="..."
```


### Configuring the Model Context Protocol Inspector

During development you can directly inspect the MCP tool call results using the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector). 

You can run it using the following command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx -y mcp-remote@latest http://localhost:8787/sse --header "\"Authorization: Bearer {INSERT_YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY_HERE}\""
```

Alternatively, you can use the following configuration in the MCP Inspector:

Use transport type `STDIO`.

**Command:**

```
npx
```

**Arguments:**

```
-y mcp-remote@latest http://localhost:8787/sse --header "Authorization: Bearer {INSERT_YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY_HERE}"
```
